# Bluely Smart Alarm - Hackathon Demo Guide

## üé≠ Demo Setup (Simplified for USB-Only)

### What Changed
- ‚úÖ **Removed WiFi/Bluetooth** - No network setup needed
- ‚úÖ **USB Serial Control** - Direct control via ESP-IDF monitor
- ‚úÖ **Instant Demo Commands** - Trigger any feature immediately
- ‚úÖ **Mobile App Demo Mode** - Shows features without network dependency

## üöÄ Quick Demo Steps

### 1. Hardware Setup
```bash
# Flash the updated firmware
cd /path/to/bluely
idf.py build flash monitor
```

### 2. Verify Demo Mode Started
Look for this in the ESP-IDF monitor:
```
=== BLUELY SMART ALARM DEMO MODE ===
üíª USB Serial Control Active - Type 'HELP' for commands
üé≠ Demo running
```

### 3. Essential Demo Commands

#### Quick Feature Demos
```bash
TRIGGER_SUNRISE     # Show 30-second sunrise simulation
TRIGGER_SUNSET      # Show 30-second sunset simulation  
TRIGGER_ALARM       # Demo progressive alarm (light + sound)
STOP_ALARM          # Stop any active demo
```

#### Configuration During Demo
```bash
SET_ALARM:07:30:1    # Set alarm to 7:30 AM, enabled
SET_BEDTIME:22:30    # Set bedtime to 10:30 PM
SET_VOLUME:80        # Set alarm volume to 80%
SET_LIGHT:90         # Set light intensity to 90%
STATUS               # Show all current settings
```

## üéØ Hackathon Presentation Flow

### 1. **Problem Introduction** (30 seconds)
- "Traditional alarms are jarring and disrupt sleep cycles"
- "We created a gentle, smart wake-up system"

### 2. **Hardware Demo** (60 seconds)
```bash
# In ESP-IDF monitor:
STATUS                    # Show current settings
TRIGGER_SUNSET           # Demo bedtime simulation
# Wait 10 seconds to see color transition
STOP_ALARM              # Reset
TRIGGER_SUNRISE         # Demo wake-up simulation
# Wait 10 seconds
TRIGGER_ALARM           # Show progressive alarm
```

### 3. **Mobile App Demo** (45 seconds)
- Open Smart Alarm page in browser
- Show sleep cycle recommendations
- Demonstrate Apple-style UI interactions
- Connect in "Demo Mode"

### 4. **Smart Features Highlight** (30 seconds)
```bash
# Show adaptive features:
SET_ALARM:07:30:1       # Set demo alarm
# Movement simulation will be shown via HW-496 sensor
STATUS                  # Show smart wake is enabled
```

### 5. **Closing** (15 seconds)
- "Transforms any hardware into intelligent sleep optimization"
- "Evidence-based features with Apple-quality UX"

## üí° Demo Tips

### If Something Goes Wrong
```bash
STOP_ALARM              # Always stops everything
HELP                    # Shows all available commands
STATUS                  # Check current state
```

### Quick Recovery Commands
```bash
# Reset to safe state:
STOP_ALARM
SET_VOLUME:50
SET_LIGHT:70
STATUS
```

### Impressive Visual Sequences
```bash
# "Sleep to wake" demo:
TRIGGER_SUNSET          # Start with bedtime
# Wait 5 seconds
TRIGGER_SUNRISE         # Natural wake transition  
# Wait 5 seconds
TRIGGER_ALARM           # Full alarm experience
# Wait 5 seconds  
STOP_ALARM              # Clean finish
```

## üé® What Judges Will See

### Mobile App Features
- **Apple-style design** with smooth animations
- **Sleep cycle science** with 90-minute recommendations  
- **Progressive audio controls** with expert defaults
- **Intuitive time selection** with wheel pickers
- **Demo mode connectivity** without network complexity

### Hardware Capabilities  
- **Progressive RGB lighting** (sunrise/sunset simulation)
- **Smart movement detection** using existing HW-496
- **Gentle alarm progression** (sound + light)
- **Persistent settings** that survive power cycles
- **Real-time serial control** for instant demo

### Technical Highlights
- **Zero hardware changes** - All existing pins preserved
- **Professional firmware** with state machine design
- **Evidence-based features** (9-min snooze, 90-min cycles)
- **Robust error handling** with visual feedback
- **Scalable architecture** ready for production

## üîß Troubleshooting

### ESP32 Not Responding
1. Press RESET button on ESP32
2. Check USB cable connection
3. Re-run `idf.py monitor`

### Commands Not Working
1. Type `HELP` to verify serial communication
2. Ensure commands are UPPERCASE
3. Use exact format: `SET_ALARM:07:30:1`

### Demo Lag
1. Commands execute immediately
2. Light transitions take 2-3 seconds for smooth effect
3. Use `STOP_ALARM` between demos for clean transitions
