| ----------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wearable API integration complexity | High   | Start with manual input, add integration if time permits |
| AI recommendation quality           | Medium | Use pre-written templates as fallback                    |
| Cross-platform compatibility        | Medium | Focus on PWA, test on multiple browsers                  |
| Time constraint                     | High   | Strict prioritization, cut features aggressively         |

### 8.2 Contingency Plans
